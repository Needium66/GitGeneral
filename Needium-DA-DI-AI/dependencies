#Decided to work on this project, which is one of the questions in an interview session
#Design a cost effective data analytics platform, with data ingestion in real-time, ensuring data quality and minimal latency

#Entered a prompt on Replit with the question

#The output is below:
#Design a cost-effective data analytics platform with 
#real-time data ingestion, 
#data quality monitoring,
#and minimal latency using Streamlit
#and Python's data science ecosystem.

#Required approval to deploy:
#Integrate with real streaming data sources
#Add ML models for predictive analytics
#Implement user authentication and role-based access
#Add datawarehouse integration: PostgreSQL

#The dependencies installed:

#streamlit
#pandas
#plotly
#numpy
#sqlite3

 Built a complete data analytics platform with real-time ingestion
✓ Implemented data quality monitoring with automated checks
✓ Created interactive dashboards with live metrics and charts
✓ Added system performance monitoring and alerts
✓ Set up SQLite database with optimized schema and indexing

The platform shows: data flowing through sales, user activity, and system metrics. 
The dashboard displays key business metrics, revenue trends, user analytics,and data quality scores with automatic refresh capabilities.
